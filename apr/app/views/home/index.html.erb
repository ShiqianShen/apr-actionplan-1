      <p>The unit should prepare an initial action plan based upon the entire APR process. The unit’s action plan should
        reflect both short-term and long-term action items that are aligned with the goals and mission of the unit,
        college/school, and university. The action items should be feasible with respect to the program/department/unit,
        college, and university resources; sustainable; and measurable. The action plan should address any shortcomings
        noted
        by the APR review team with respect to the APR Criterion, be reflective of any goals of the program based upon
        the
        unit’s mission and strategic planning initiatives, and take into account the review team’s recommendations or
        comments, where appropriate.
      </p>

      <p>The initial action plan or the annual update to the action plan should be arranged according to UNM’s current
        Academic Program Review Criteria (see attached document or refer to the APR Policy Manual found at apr.unm.edu).
        Comments or a brief narrative explaining the action items or updates should be included at the end of each
        Criterion
        section.
      </p>

      <p>Each action item should include:</p>

      <ol type="1">
        <li>A description of the action item and associated tasks written in measurable terms with appropriate
          measurable
          outcome(s)/metrics.
        </li>
        <li>The person(s) responsible for this action</li>
        <li>Resources needed for completing the action item (if there are budgetary requirements, please indicate the
          amount,
          funding source, and approvals for the funding source).
          <strong><i>If an action item requires significant external resources, a plan for how those resources will be
            obtained must be provided.</i></strong>
        </li>

        <li>A timeline for implementation with the projected start date and target date for completion.</li>

        <li>The current status of the item or task</li>
      </ol>
